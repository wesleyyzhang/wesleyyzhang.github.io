    <h1>CS 180 Final Project: Lightfield Camera: Depth Refocusing and Aperture Adjustment with Light Field Data</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
      In this project, we reproduce some of the complex effects of focusing a camera by using simple methods like shifting and averaging 
      on real lightfield data. We will use the chess dataset from the Stanford Light Field Archive. 
      
    </p>

    

    <h2>Part 1: Depth Refocusing</h2>

    <p>
      First, we will generate multiple images which focus at different depths within the image. When moving the camera around 
      while keeping the optical axis unchanged, we see that the position of nearby objects varies significantly, while 
      the position of far away objects doesn't vary that much. By appropriately shifting the images before averaging
      them, we can create images which focus at different depths. 
      
    </p>

    <p>
      The dataset contains 289 images, which represent a grid of images from (0, 0) to (16, 16), with the image at (8, 8) 
      being the center image. First, we get the shift of the center image. We then go through every image in the dataset
      and subtract each of their shifts by the shift of the center image. We then use this newly calculate
      shift to adjust the image accordingly. We will also introduce the weight variable that controls the strength of the shift. 
      This can be summed up in these expressions: weight*(y - center_y), weight*(x - center_x). The results are shown below:

      <div class="image-box2">
          <h3>c=0</h3>
          <img src="media/weight0.png" alt="Monastery Image">
      </div>

      <div class="image-box2">
          <h3>c=0.5</h3>

      </div>
    </div>

    </div>
    

    <h2>Part 2: Aperture Adjustment</h2>

    <p>
      Next, we will reproduce the effect of changing the aperture of images. We do this by using a smaller subset of images
      and finding the average of them. Again, we will let the image at (8, 8) be the center. We will now introduce a radius term, 
      which dictates which images in the grid to use. For example, if the radius were 1, then images that are a distance of 1 away
      from the center image will be used, which are the images at (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 7), (9, 8), 
      and (9, 9). The results are shown below:
    </p>

    <div class="side-by-side">
      <div class="image-box2">
          <h3>Radius=0</h3>
          <img src="media/aperture0.png" alt="Monastery Image">
      </div>

      <div class="image-box2">
          <h3>Radius=2</h3>
          <img src="media/aperture2.png" alt="Monastery Image">
      </div>

      <div class="image-box2">
          <h3>Radius=4</h3>
          <img src="media/aperture4.png" alt="Monastery Image">
      </div>
    </div>

    
    <div class="side-by-side">
      <div class="image-box2">
          <h3>Radius=6</h3>
          <img src="media/aperture6.png" alt="Monastery Image">

    <h2>Part 3: Summary</h2>

    <p>
      In this project, I learned how to recreate the effects of adjusting the focus of images by taking a set of images
      in a dataset and finding the average of the appropriate images. I was able to get a good understanding of why
      adjusting certain aspects of a camera produces different results. Overall, it was a very interesting topic and 
      helped me understand a lot!
